00:00.800 --> 00:03.000
Welcome to this talk,
 I'm Glen Mével, and with

00:03.000 --> 00:04.480
Jacques-Henri Jourdan
 and François Pottier,

00:04.480 --> 00:07.320
we've been working on
 a concurrent separation logic

00:07.320 --> 00:09.720
for Multicore OCaml
 What does that mean?

00:09.720 --> 00:12.840
Our aim is to verify,
 fine-grained concurrent programs

00:12.840 --> 00:14.240
in the setting
 of the Multicore

00:14.240 --> 00:18.160
OCaml memory model,
 which is a weak memory model.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.520
In this talk,
 I present a concurrent

00:20.520 --> 00:23.440
separation logic
 with a notion of views.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.600
So a few words about
 Multicore Ocaml:

00:27.600 --> 00:29.880
as the name suggests,
 it is an extension

00:29.880 --> 00:31.440
of the OCaml
 programming language

00:31.440 --> 00:34.120
with support
 for multicore programming.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.320
It comes with a weak memory model
 which has been formalized

00:37.320 --> 00:40.520
in a paper at PLDI '18,
 and it features

00:40.520 --> 00:45.520
two flavors of locations
 which are dubbed "atomic" and "non-atomic".

00:46.120 --> 00:48.520
By the way if you're interested
 in the garbage collector

00:48.520 --> 00:50.920
of Multicore OCaml,
 please have a look

00:50.920 --> 00:53.160
at this other ICFP paper, whose title is

00:53.160 --> 00:56.520
"Retrofitting
 Parallelism onto OCaml."

00:57.400 --> 00:59.200
So what is the challenge here?

00:59.200 --> 01:01.360
Essentially, the challenge
 is dealing with

01:01.360 --> 01:04.280
the weak memory.
 Under sequential consistency,

01:04.280 --> 01:07.080
traditional concurrent
 separation logic

01:07.080 --> 01:10.520
gives you a points-to assertion,
 "x points to V"

01:10.520 --> 01:12.920
which expresses your
 unique ownership

01:12.920 --> 01:16.120
of the memory location x
 and which also

01:16.120 --> 01:19.440
says which value
 is stored in x.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.880
Then you have the usual
 Hoare-style reasoning rules.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.880
This assertion
 gives you ownership of x

01:25.880 --> 01:27.120
but you may
 want to share

01:27.120 --> 01:29.680
this ownership
 among all threads.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.120
To do so, an usual solution
 is to put the assertion

01:33.120 --> 01:35.280
in an invariant.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.880
Intuitively an invariant
 holds at all times,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.520
and its contents
 can be accessed equally

01:40.520 --> 01:42.320
by all threads.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.640
Here, we can put
 "x points to something"

01:45.640 --> 01:47.920
in an invariant
 (which we denote

01:47.920 --> 01:50.960
by boxing the assertion),
 then any thread

01:50.960 --> 01:56.360
can access x as long as
 it preserves the invariant.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.680
Now, what breaks
 under a weak memory model

01:59.680 --> 02:02.240
is that each thread
 now has a different

02:02.240 --> 02:04.960
view of memory.
 This notion of view

02:04.960 --> 02:08.360
is crucial, because it means
 that some assertions

02:08.360 --> 02:11.560
like the points-to assertion
 are only valid

02:11.560 --> 02:14.640
with respect
 to the current view of a thread.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.240
We call these kinds
 of assertions

02:17.240 --> 02:21.640
subjective assertions.
 But on the other hand,

02:21.640 --> 02:24.320
invariants hold
 equally for all threads,

02:24.320 --> 02:26.960
so they can only contain
 objective assertions

02:26.960 --> 02:32.080
where by objective
 we mean non-subjective.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.200
Then the challenge
 is to keep a program logic

02:35.200 --> 02:37.880
which feels simple
 and natural enough

02:37.880 --> 02:39.960
but at the same time
 is able to deal

02:39.960 --> 02:42.160
with subjectivity,
 and allows

02:42.160 --> 02:45.320
subjective assertions
 to be shared between threads.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.040
I just spoke about the view
 of a thread and how it is

02:51.040 --> 02:54.080
central to the challenge
 of weak memory,

02:54.080 --> 02:55.960
but I haven't defined
 this concept yet,

02:55.960 --> 02:59.360
so let me do that now.
 Because of weak memory

02:59.360 --> 03:02.200
each thread only knows
 a subset of all writes

03:02.200 --> 03:05.000
that have happened
 to the shared memory.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.120
This affects how
 a thread reads

03:09.120 --> 03:11.440
and writes the memory.
 For example,

03:11.440 --> 03:14.120
once it has learned
 about a write,

03:14.120 --> 03:17.440
it cannot read
 from earlier writes anymore.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.360
This is an example
 of what a weak

03:19.360 --> 03:24.880
memory model would say you.
 And this subset of write events,

03:24.880 --> 03:27.120
we will call it a view.
 So the view of a thread

03:27.120 --> 03:30.440
is the set of
 write events it knows about.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.480
is the set of
 write events it knows about.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.040
Now, we want to manipulate
 these views from the logic.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.800
For that, we add new
 kinds of assertions.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.880
The first new kind
 of assertions is

03:43.880 --> 03:46.880
this "up-arrow U"
 where U is a view,

03:46.880 --> 03:49.960
we pronounce it
 as "we have seen U",

03:49.960 --> 03:51.840
and it means that
 the current thread

03:51.840 --> 03:53.960
knows all writes in U.
 So it is an assertion

03:53.960 --> 03:57.440
about the current view
 of the thread.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.800
The second
 new assertion is "P at U",

04:00.800 --> 04:03.080
where P
 is an assertion

04:03.080 --> 04:07.040
and U is a view.
 It means that P holds in the eyes

04:07.040 --> 04:09.920
of any thread
 which has seen U.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.280
For example, let's say
 that P relies

04:13.280 --> 04:15.520
on knowing
 a given write event.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.200
Then it requires the current view
 to contain that write event.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.800
So asserting P is subjective.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.240
But instead we're going to
 say that whatever

04:25.240 --> 04:27.760
the current view is,
 if it contains

04:27.760 --> 04:31.160
that write event,
 then P holds.

04:31.160 --> 04:35.240
And by saying this, we do not
 depend anymore on the current view.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.320
So saying this is objective,
 even though P

04:39.320 --> 04:42.240
may be subjective.
 And that's what

04:42.240 --> 04:47.240
"P at U" means when
 U contains the given write event.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.840
So we can make
 a subjective assertion objective

04:51.840 --> 04:56.840
by specifying the view
 at which we see it.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.720
And why is it
 interesting?

05:00.720 --> 05:04.080
Because these new
 assertions are complementary.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.080
More precisely, in our logic,
 any assertion P

05:08.080 --> 05:10.160
is equivalent

05:10.160 --> 05:12.960
to an objective assertion
 of the form "P at U",

05:12.960 --> 05:16.320
to an objective assertion
 of the form "P at U",

05:16.320 --> 05:19.480
and a assertion of the form,
 "up-arrow U",

05:19.480 --> 05:23.640
for some view U.
 This shows in particular

05:23.640 --> 05:27.320
that view assertions
 of the form "up-arrow U"

05:27.320 --> 05:29.760
capture all the
 subjectivity of the

05:29.760 --> 05:33.240
weak memory.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.960
And this decomposition will allow us
 to share subjective assertions

05:37.960 --> 05:40.320
between threads, by using
 a different mechanism for each part.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.480
The first part, "P at U",

05:45.480 --> 05:46.320
is objective

05:46.320 --> 05:48.720
so it can be shared via an invariant,

05:48.720 --> 05:50.440
so it can be shared via an invariant,

05:50.440 --> 05:54.600
just as in usual
 concurrent separation logics.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.080
Regarding the second part,

05:56.080 --> 05:58.080
sharing "up-arrow U"

05:58.080 --> 05:59.960
means exchanging information

05:59.960 --> 06:02.200
about write events between threads.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.040
So in other words,

06:03.040 --> 06:05.320
it means synchronizing.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.200
So we will rely on some form
 of thread synchronization

06:09.200 --> 06:11.720
that is provided by the memory model.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.640
That was the main idea of this talk.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.560
Now I show you what is
 in our program logic,

06:20.560 --> 06:22.440
to reason about programs and memory,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.200
and I'll start with the simplest thing,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.520
which are atomic locations.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.880
For atomic locations,

06:28.880 --> 06:31.520
we have an usual-looking
 points-to assertion,

06:32.920 --> 06:34.680
"atomic x points to v",

06:34.680 --> 06:36.160
which means that we own the

06:36.160 --> 06:38.080
atomic location x,

06:38.080 --> 06:39.600
and x stores the value v.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.680
We are able to say such a thing,

06:43.680 --> 06:46.680
because atomic locations
 in Multicore OCaml

06:46.680 --> 06:49.040
behave in a sequentially consistent way.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.120
At any given time,

06:50.120 --> 06:52.920
all threads see the same value for x.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.840
In particular,

06:55.840 --> 06:57.520
this assertion is objective,

06:58.480 --> 07:00.320
then it should come as no surprise

07:00.320 --> 07:03.000
that atomic accesses obey the usual

07:03.000 --> 07:06.360
Hoare triples, both reads and writes.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.760
Where things become interesting,

07:10.760 --> 07:12.800
is for non-atomic locations.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.520
The non-atomic locations of Multicore

07:14.520 --> 07:16.960
OCaml have a relaxed behavior.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.280
In our logic we still have
 an assertion "x points to v",

07:21.280 --> 07:23.440
with its meaning differ slightly.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.200
It still asserts the ownership of x,

07:25.200 --> 07:26.800
but instead of saying that

07:27.640 --> 07:29.160
the value of x is v,

07:29.160 --> 07:32.360
it says that we have seen
 the latest write to x,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.040
and this write bears the value v.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.880
And this is the typical
 subjective assertion.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.360
There is no such a thing as

07:40.360 --> 07:42.240
the global value of x,

07:42.240 --> 07:45.360
because different threads
 do not necessarily know

07:45.360 --> 07:46.800
about the same writes to x.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.720
What is really nice with
 this points-to assertion,

07:52.720 --> 07:55.240
is that it also obeys the standard rules.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.920
So we have a simple looking assertion

07:58.920 --> 08:00.720
that behaves in a natural way,

08:00.720 --> 08:03.760
but the price for it
 is that the assertion

08:03.760 --> 08:08.040
hides more behind the scenes
 and it is subjective.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.240
So we cannot share it

08:09.240 --> 08:11.480
only by using an invariant.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.440
So let's see how
 we can share it nonetheless,

08:15.440 --> 08:17.320
and for that,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.520
let's consider that typical code pattern

08:19.520 --> 08:20.920
which is called a spin lock.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.320
Let's say we have several threads,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.200
that want to access the same resource,

08:26.200 --> 08:29.440
such as a single non-atomic location.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.000
Then we can use an atomic
 flag to guard that resource:

08:32.000 --> 08:33.200
when the flag is true,

08:33.200 --> 08:34.360
the resource is taken,

08:34.360 --> 08:35.920
and if you want to acquire it,

08:35.920 --> 08:38.640
you need to wait for
 it to become available.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.520
Now from a logical point of view,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.920
the lock can be seen as
 guarding an assertion P,

08:43.920 --> 08:45.080
which may be subjective,

08:45.080 --> 08:45.920
for example,

08:45.920 --> 08:47.720
it may be a non-atomic
 points-to assertion,

08:47.720 --> 08:49.680
as evoked just before.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.760
The first thread has P

08:51.760 --> 08:53.520
before releasing the lock.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.400
The second thread will get P
 after it has acquired the lock.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.920
So we want P to be transferred

08:59.920 --> 09:02.760
from the first thread to the second one.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.480
To see how that works,

09:05.480 --> 09:06.920
let's consider

09:06.920 --> 09:09.640
only the compare-and-set
 operation that succeeds,

09:09.640 --> 09:12.840
because that's when the transfer happens.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.280
As we've seen we decompose
 P into an objective part

09:17.280 --> 09:18.600
and a subjective part,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.360
so that we can transfer each part.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.680
The first part, "P at U", is objective.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.440
So it can be transferred
 using an invariant as usual.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.040
So we get rid of it.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.120
So now we are down to the problem

09:31.120 --> 09:33.200
of transferring a view assertion.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.040
As I said before,

09:36.040 --> 09:38.640
we need some form of
 synchronization and, here,

09:38.640 --> 09:40.000
What Multicore OCaml gives us

09:40.000 --> 09:42.160
is a happens-before relationship

09:42.160 --> 09:45.520
from the release write
 to the acquire read.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.440
So instead of adding
 new primitives to the language,

09:48.440 --> 09:50.080
Multicore OCaml made the choice

09:50.080 --> 09:53.360
of performing release/acquire
 synchronization on atomic access.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.040
We need to reflect
 this in our program logic,

09:58.040 --> 09:59.720
and we do so

09:59.720 --> 10:01.920
by extending the atomic
 points-to predicate.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.760
So recall that "atomic points to v"

10:07.760 --> 10:09.760
means that x stores the value v.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.200
We now extend this assertion,

10:13.200 --> 10:16.080
so that an atomic location stores the pair

10:16.960 --> 10:18.160
of a value and a view.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.000
So accesses still behave the same

10:23.000 --> 10:25.040
with respect to the value,

10:25.960 --> 10:29.920
but they also perform a
 release/acquire synchronization

10:29.920 --> 10:30.760
on the view.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.920
So when writing,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.200
we push into the shared location,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.960
any information we have in the local view.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.200
So that's a release write.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.400
And conversely,

10:42.400 --> 10:46.440
when reading, we pull into our local view

10:46.440 --> 10:49.480
any information stored
 in the shared location.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.720
So that's an acquire read.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.040
And with this in mind,

10:54.040 --> 10:55.680
let's come back to our spin lock.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.640
As we have seen before,

10:58.640 --> 11:01.080
the spin lock has two operations,

11:01.080 --> 11:02.960
release and acquire.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.880
In the interface it guards an assertion P.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.200
We give the spin lock a specification,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.800
which holds under some invariant.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.880
And now,

11:11.880 --> 11:16.080
to prove this specification in
 the usual separation logic,

11:17.160 --> 11:18.640
with sequential consistency,

11:19.640 --> 11:21.440
we state an invariant like this:

11:22.400 --> 11:25.560
we are either locked or unlocked,

11:25.560 --> 11:26.840
and in the latter case

11:26.840 --> 11:29.760
the invariant itself holds the assertion P.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.920
Now in our program
 logic with weak memory,

11:35.920 --> 11:37.560
P may be subjective,

11:37.560 --> 11:41.000
but everything in the
 invariant has to be objective.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.840
So the invariant we
 state instead is that one.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.520
In fact,

11:49.520 --> 11:52.600
it is the same as in
 usual separation logic,

11:52.600 --> 11:54.000
but we add views.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.920
To remain objective,

11:55.920 --> 11:57.240
we make it explicit

11:57.240 --> 12:00.120
at which view we have P,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.280
and we say that it is the same view

12:02.280 --> 12:04.000
as is stored in lk.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.240
In other words,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.560
P holds in the eyes of whoever

12:09.560 --> 12:11.120
last released the lock.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.560
So that "P at U" in the invariant

12:16.560 --> 12:18.360
obviously allows to transfer

12:18.360 --> 12:20.800
the objective part of P,

12:20.800 --> 12:22.520
while the atomic location itself

12:22.520 --> 12:26.360
allows to transfer the
 subjective part of P.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.520
So that was the proof of the spin lock.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.960
And in addition to this example,

12:35.960 --> 12:38.440
we did more case studies with
 different kinds of locks

12:38.440 --> 12:41.600
and algorithms for mutual exclusion,

12:41.600 --> 12:42.960
and in all of these examples,

12:42.960 --> 12:46.280
we have been experiencing the same pattern

12:46.280 --> 12:51.400
of sprinkling views over our invariants.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.720
So a general method
 for proving correctness

12:54.720 --> 12:57.000
of a concurrent data structure,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.880
is to start by reasoning

12:58.880 --> 13:01.560
as if we had a sequentially
 consistent model,

13:01.560 --> 13:04.240
express the invariant in the usual

13:04.240 --> 13:06.040
concurrent separation logic.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.000
Then identify where
 synchronization happens,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.080
and make it explicit by adding views.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.080
To sum up I have presented
 a program logic

13:18.080 --> 13:19.880
for Multicore OCaml,

13:19.880 --> 13:22.720
based on isolating
 subjectivity into views.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.640
I argued that this logic enables concise

13:25.640 --> 13:29.120
and natural reasoning on
 how threads synchronize.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.360
There is more in the paper,

13:31.360 --> 13:34.720
namely how the logic is realized,

13:34.720 --> 13:36.920
by building on top of a lower-level logic.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.880
And we also have more case studies.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.240
This entire work is mechanized
 in the Coq proof assistant,

13:45.240 --> 13:48.120
using the Iris separation logic framework.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.680
So we have a verified proof of soundness,

13:50.680 --> 13:53.760
and a toy language with
 which we can write programs

13:53.760 --> 13:57.120
and prove them correct using
 our program logic.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.800
And in the future,

13:59.800 --> 14:02.680
we would like to verify
 even more data structures.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.080
Also we would like to
 investigate data races,

14:06.080 --> 14:08.880
because data races are currently
 not supported in logic,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.480
even though the underlying memory model

14:13.480 --> 14:15.640
gives a few guarantees about them.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.280
Thank you for your attention,

14:18.280 --> 14:20.240
and if you have seen all previous slides,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.840
you hold the right to
 ask questions now.
