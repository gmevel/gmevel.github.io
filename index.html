		With my advisors
		<a href="../~fpottier/">François Pottier</a> (Inria)
		and <a href="https://jhjourdan.mketjh.fr">Jacques‐Henri Jourdan</a>
		(LMF),
		we aim at establishing a program logic for proving correctness of
		<a href="http://ocamllabs.io/doc/multicore.html">Multicore OCaml</a>
		programs. For that, we are using the
		<a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a> proof assistant and the
		<a href="https://iris-project.org">Iris</a> separation logic.

				We use Cosmo, a modern concurrent separation logic, to formally
				specify and verify an implementation of a multiple-producer
				multiple-consumer concurrent queue in the setting of the
				Multicore OCaml weak memory model. We view this result as a
				demonstration and experimental verification of the manner in
				which Cosmo allows modular and formal reasoning about advanced
				concurrent data structures. In particular, we show how the joint
				use of logically atomic triples and of Cosmo's views makes it
				possible to describe precisely in the specification the
				interaction between the queue library and the weak memory model.

			<blockquote>
				Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with support for shared-memory
				concurrency. It is equipped with a weak memory model, for which
				an operational semantics has been published. This begs the
				question: what reasoning rules can one rely upon while writing
				or verifying Multicore OCaml code? To answer it, we instantiate
				Iris, a modern descendant of Concurrent Separation Logic, for
				Multicore OCaml. This yields a low-level program logic whose
				reasoning rules expose the details of the memory model. On top
				of it, we build a higher-level logic, Cosmo, which trades off
				some expressive power in return for a simple set of reasoning
				rules that allow accessing nonatomic locations in a
				data-race-free manner, exploiting the sequentially-consistent
				behavior of atomic locations, and exploiting the release/acquire
				behavior of atomic locations. Cosmo allows both low-level
				reasoning, where the details of the Multicore OCaml memory model
				are apparent, and high-level reasoning, which is independent of
				this memory model. We illustrate this claim via a number of case
				studies: we verify several implementations of locks with respect
				to a classic, memory-model-independent specification. Thus, a
				coarse-grained application that uses locks as the sole means of
				synchronization can be verified in the
				Concurrent-Separation-Logic fragment of Cosmo, without any
				knowledge of the weak memory model.

			<blockquote>
				We present a machine-checked extension of the program logic Iris
				with time credits and time receipts, two dual means of reasoning
				about time.
				Whereas time credits are used to establish an upper bound on a
				program's execution time, time receipts can be used to establish
				a lower bound. More strikingly, time receipts can be used to
				prove that certain undesirable events — such as integer
				overflows — cannot occur until a very long time has elapsed. We
				present several machine-checked applications of time credits and
				time receipts, including an application where both concepts are
				exploited.
